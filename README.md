# Python Calculator

This project is a **simple calculator** implemented in Python using the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** paradigm. The calculator allows you to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

## Features
### Select the operation:
When you run the program, a menu will appear where you can choose the operation you want to perform. Enter the corresponding number for the operation and then enter the numbers you wish to operate on:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exponentiation

### View the result:
The program will display the result of the selected operation. If you select division and the divisor is 0, the program will show an error message.


- **Addition:** Allows you to add two numbers.
